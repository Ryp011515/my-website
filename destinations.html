<h2>3 Environmental Problems <span class="small">What are these problems?</span></h2>


<div class="list-free blur" id="link1">


<h3 class="order1"> Desertification</h3>


<div class="text order2">
<p>Desertification results from human activity being too reckless to the earth. Large areas of the planet are being desertified at a significant rate.
<p>Desertification is a hard thing to stop as people don’t really have anything to do against it since people have a hard time getting supplies. Places where desertification happens are where people are poor and don't have time and money to stop this environmental problem.
<p>How could we stop this huge environmental problem?</p>
</div>


<div class="image w2 order3">
<img src="images/5.jpg" alt="">
<div>
<p>This is a picture of the ground that's desertified and It's not possible to have life in this environment. As you can see this is a really hard environment to live in since there's no animal life and no water which makes no crops.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="text order2">
<h4> How does desertification affect the environment and human society? How can we change this problem?</h4>
<p>The risk of desertification affects some of the poorest and most vulnerable populations the hardest, since farming is common across many of the affected regions. There’s no alternative because people have no money to meet and grow all the way to a good business. More than 75 percent of the Earth's land area is already subtle as more than 90 percent could become degraded by 2050. People will have a hard time getting land that is usable as there will be no places to plant trees as well as crops. Some countries would be the most affected, as Africa and Asia being the most.


   To solve the problem and make a temporary stop is getting sustainable land management, water conservation, reforestation, and supporting local communities. The only problem is that people don't have money, especially for the poor. The country's government has to do something to stop this and people need to cooperate to stop this problem. These are definitely not easy to do, but if we can do these things, we can make a change to the environment and the human society.</p>

<h3 class="order1 mt2">Deforestation</h3>


<div class="text order1 mt1">


<p>Most deforestation is occurring in tropical rainforests, because of road construction in regions that were not possible by car. Building or upgrading roads into forests makes them more accessible for exploitation. The land is only fertile for a few years. However, after that, the farmers move on to repeat the process elsewhere. Tropical forests are also cleared to make way for logging, oil palming and many more just because of selfish humans.</p>
<p>More carbon dioxide may be emitted into the atmosphere as a result of deforestation. This is because carbon is chemically trapped in trees' wood, and they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis. This carbon is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide when trees are burned. Carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere and speeds up global warming when there are fewer trees to absorb it.</p>
<p>Deforestation also endangers the world's biodiversity. Tropical woods are home to numerous animal and plant species. When forests are logged or burned, many species become extinct. Some scientists believe we are already in the midst of a catastrophic extinction event.</p>
<p>More immediately, the removal of trees from a forest might make the soil more susceptible to erosion. This makes the remaining plants more vulnerable to fire as the forest transitions from a closed, damp environment to an open, dry one.</p>
<p>Deforestation can be permanent, but it is not always the case. Forests are regrowing in several places in North America as a result of conservation efforts.</p>

<p> How deforestation is something that is very devastating and hard to stop. The land is now almost vacant land as they want more land to make money. These people won't care about what the environment is, and they plan to make a fortune with their new land.


</p>
</div>
<img src="images/7.jpg" alt="">
<div>
<p>How mountain fires and natural disasters can cause deforestation. Mountain fires can be caused by selfish humans who can throw burnable trash and throw cigarettes. These can cause way more damage than just cutting trees as mountain fires can cause about 8000 hectares of land.</p>

<h3 class="order3">Air polution</h3>


<div class="text order1 mt1">
<h4>How does air pollution affect the social economy?</h4>
<p>Air pollution leads to increased healthcare costs, loss of productivity, and diminished workforce efficiency. These factors will be affected significantly, especially in industry main countries, as people will suffocate from air diseases. </p>
<p>Air pollution is because of the indoor and outdoor environment caused by any chemicals and physical things. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>The WHO data show that almost all the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with poor and developing countries suffering the most.</p>
<p>Air quality is linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Some jobs, like policies, reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, as well as contribute to the long cycle of climate change.</p>

<h4> How do these problems become a hindrance to a goal to Healthy Environments and Healthy Humans?</h4>
<p>The problems are that desertification, deforestation, and air pollution are all caused by humans. These problems are caused by humans because of the need for more land to make money and the need for more resources to make money. These problems are also caused by the need for more land to make money and the need for more resources to make money. These problems are also caused by the need for more land to make money and the need for more resources to make money.</p>
<p>These problems are caused by the need for more land to make money and the need for more resources to make money. These problems are also caused by the need for more land to make money and the need for more resources to make money. These problems are also caused by the need for more land to make money and the need for more resources to make money.</p>
<p>To stop this people need to stop being so greedy and have a sense of pungency. People will have less time to be within nature and researches have shown that touching grass can literally grow your lifespan. These will cause problems in social life as there will be shortage of people especially for right now. This means that a healthy environment can make a healthy society as well as humans.</p>
